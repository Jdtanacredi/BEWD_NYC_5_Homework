**Final Project Proposal**
==========================


For my final project I'm going to be working on a Flash Sale Site with a unique pricing system that is affected by user demand. Items will be up for a set period of time and once the time is over, everyone gets the products for the adjusted price.

**Possible Dificulties**        

* The hardest part of completing this project will be finding a payment system that handles information similar to Kickstarter.
* Handling a database with multiple tables/columns


**APIs**

* Checkout system - TBD
