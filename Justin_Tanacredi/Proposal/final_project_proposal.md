**Final Project Proposal**
==========================


For my final project I'm going to be working on a Flash Sale Site with a unique pricing system that is affected by user demand. Items will be up for a set period of time and once the time is over, everyone gets the products for the adjusted price.

I have already built part of this app and have a rough idea of my db schema, but I want to completely redo it using what I learned in class.

**Possible Dificulties**        

* Finding a payment system that handles information similar to Kickstarter. Receives payment information in the beginning, but does not charge until product ends.
* Handling a database with multiple tables/columns


**APIs**

* Checkout system - TBD
